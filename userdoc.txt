INPUT INFO:

	INPUT PRECISION:

		Inputs are passed as NORMALIZED FLOAT values. 
		This allows a maximum precision of 6 decimal places.

	INPUT LIMITS:

		As inputs are NORMALIZED FLOAT values, entered input must not exceed ±3.4E+38.
		The smallest positive value allowed is 1.2E-38.

	EXAMPLE GOOD INPUT:
		
		4 12.0 2.182345 - All values in valid range & no illegal characters.
		
	EXAMPLE BAD INPUT:
		
		a4 12.1234567 3.4e+39 - Illegal character value, 
					value out of range of precision,
					value greater than maximum.
		

OUTPUT INFO:

	OUTPUT PRECISION:

		Output values are passed as NORMALIZED DOUBLE values.
		This allows a maximum precision of 15 decimal places.

	OUTPUT LIMITS:

		As output values are NORMALIZED DOUBLE values, output cannot exceed ±1.7E+308.
		The smallest positive value allowed is 2.3E-308.


HOW TO USE:

	This program is designed to take input from STDIN, which is redirected to a file. 
	To use this program, simply enter your a, b, and c values in separate single lines in 
	'input/user_input.in'. Then, type 'make userrun' in the terminal. This will compile the 
	quad solver program and run it using the 'user_input.in' file. Your results will be in 
	the file 'output/user_output.out'.

	Take heed of input information above, as the program will output errors in the 
	'logs/userlogs.txt' file with information on why it failed.

	EXAMPLE:

		user_input.in
		--------------
		9 12 4
		4.0 6.0 18.0

		terminal
		--------------
		.../src$ make userrun
