HOW TO USE:

	This program is designed to take input from STDIN, which is redirected to a file. 
	To use this program, simply enter your a, b, and c values in a single line in 
	'src/user_input.in'. Take heed of input information above, as the program will 
	output errors in one of the logs*.txt files with information on why it failed.

	EXAMPLE:

		user_input.in
		--------------
		3 4 12
		4.0 6.0 18.0
